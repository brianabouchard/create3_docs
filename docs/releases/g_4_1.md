[[Click here to download release G.4.1]](https://github.com/iRobotEducation/create3_docs/releases/download/G.4.1/Create3-G.4.1.swu)

For iRobot® Education Bluetooth[^1] users, this is mostly a bugfix release.
For ROS 2[^2] users, this is mostly a feature release.
See below for details.


## This release is running ROS 2 Galactic with the following interface library versions:

- [irobot_create_msgs - 1.2.4](https://github.com/iRobotEducation/irobot_create_msgs/tree/1.2.4)
- [cyclonedds - 0.8.1](https://github.com/eclipse-cyclonedds/cyclonedds/tree/0.8.1)
- [Fast-DDS - 2.3.3](https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS/tree/2.3.3)

## Release Overview
There have been no changes to the [ROS 2 API](../../api/ros2/).
Support has been added for the robot to use a [Fast-DDS Discovery Server](https://fast-dds.docs.eprosima.com/en/latest/fastdds/ros2/discovery_server/ros2_discovery_server.html).
Some bugs have been found and fixed in the iRobot® Education Bluetooth protocol implementation.
The default route should be properly set when the robot is connected to Ethernet-over-USB (but not Wi-Fi).

## Changelog (from G.3.1)
### Core Robot
* Webserver
    * Added menu for beta features; hopefully more to come soon.
    * Exposed page for beta feature: serial device forwarding over a socket.
    * Added options for use of Fast-DDS Discovery server to Application Configuration page.
    * More consistent application of the style sheets across the UI.
    * Factory Reset option should now be available over Soft AP mode (bugfix).
    * Fix "easy" update (over the Internet) to be aware of different ROS versions, and to update properly.

* Connectivity

* OS
    * Fixed a bug on boot which could cause the system to hang during an update, sometimes causing the robot not to properly update (often with a mysterious red light).

### ROS 2
* Implement option to use a Fast-DDS discovery server when RMW is set to Fast-DDS.
* Add parameter to disable `odom` transformations [(#144)](https://github.com/iRobotEducation/create3_docs/issues/144)
* IMU update rate is now 100 Hz

### iRobot® Education Bluetooth protocol mode
