## Changelog (from H.1.0)
### ROS 2
* Fix for issue involving goal timeouts with Fast-DDS
* `cmd_audio` subscription is now `reliable` instead of `best-effort` [(#356)](https://github.com/iRobotEducation/create3_docs/issues/356)

    !!!important
        A "best-effort" publisher will no longer be able to communicate with this subscription. See [this compatibility matrix](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Concepts/About-Quality-of-Service-Settings.html#qos-compatibilities) for details.
