# iRobot® Create® 3 Release G.3.1
[[Click here to download release G.3.1]](https://github.com/iRobotEducation/create3_docs/releases/download/G.3.1/Create3-G.3.1.swu)

Note: A G.3.2 patch release is installed on some new robots from the factory.
There is no user-facing difference between these two firmware versions; the difference is related to the manufacturing process.

For iRobot® Education Bluetooth[^1] users, this is mostly a feature release.
For ROS 2[^2] users, this is mostly a bugfix release.
See below for details.


## This release is running ROS 2 Galactic with the following interface library versions:

- [irobot_create_msgs - 1.2.4](https://github.com/iRobotEducation/irobot_create_msgs/tree/1.2.4)
- [cyclonedds - 0.8.1](https://github.com/eclipse-cyclonedds/cyclonedds/tree/0.8.1)
- [Fast-DDS - 2.3.3](https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS/tree/2.3.3)

## Release Overview
As with the last release, this one provides the robot's sensors and controls via topics, actions, and services; for more, see [ROS 2 API](../../api/ros2/).
There have been no changes to the ROS 2 API.

iRobot® Education Bluetooth protocol functionality has been further improved in this release, adding the seventh IR proximity sensor, and some commands related to docking and the docking sensor.
We have changed the robot's policy to disable all reflexes while in this mode (instead of just the bump reflex).
The robot should also respond more rapidly to disconnection.
