## Release Overview

This release provides the robot's sensors and controls via topics, actions, and services, see [ROS 2 API](../../api/ros2/).

The robot runs a webserver for updating software, configuring to the network, getting error logs from the robot, and configuring ROS 2 environment variables and parameters.
This release has some known issues using the network configuration webserver page to associate with networks using characters that are not alphanumeric 7-bit ASCII.
If there is an issue getting on the network, it is recommended to first update the software via the robot's host AP mode, then try getting on the network with the latest version, see [Create® 3 Setup](https://edu.irobot.com/create3-setup).
