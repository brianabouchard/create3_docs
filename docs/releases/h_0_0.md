This release is considered a beta. Please [report any issues](https://github.com/iRobotEducation/create3_docs/issues) as they are encountered.

!!! bug
    This beta release is not stable in BLE mode. Please be sure the [USB/BLE toggle](../../hw/adapter/#usbble-toggle) on the adapter board is switched to "USB" before using this firmware.

## This release is running ROS 2 Humble with the following interface library versions:

- [irobot_create_msgs - 2.1.0](https://github.com/iRobotEducation/irobot_create_msgs/tree/2.1.0)
- [cyclonedds - 0.9.0](https://github.com/eclipse-cyclonedds/cyclonedds/tree/0.9.0)
- [Fast-DDS - 2.6.2](https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS/tree/2.6.2)

## Release Overview
This release has feature parity with [G.3.1](../g_3_1), except that ROS 2[^1] has been upgraded to Humble.

### ROS 2

As with the last release, this one provides the robot's sensors and controls via topics, actions, and services; for more, see [ROS 2 API](../../api/ros2/).

Between Galactic and Humble, the docking API (messages, actions, and topics) have slightly changed as follows:

* the `DockServo` action is now `Dock` to match the `Undock` action [(example here)](../../api/docking/#docking)
* the `/dock` topic (and `Dock` message) is now `/dock_status` (and `DockStatus` message) to avoid confusion with the action [(example here)](../../api/docking/#dock-information)

### iRobot® Education Bluetooth protocol mode

iRobot® Education Bluetooth[^2] protocol mode is not supported.
